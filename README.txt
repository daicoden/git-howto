git-howto is a quick way to remember, and subsequently look up, how to do
something in git. Whenever you find yourself googling for how to do something
in git, add it to git-howto's database. Next time you'd reach for Google,
just run "git howto YOUR-SEARCH" and get an answer!

To get started, put git-howto on your $PATH, and drop howto.md next to it. The
best way to do this is probably to add the git-howto repository directory to
your $PATH, because you're going to want to contribute back. When you've
amassed a few (or many) additions to the howto.md database, fork the project
on GitHub, commit, and send a pull request!
